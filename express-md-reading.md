## Things I want to know more about

So far nothing have come to mind

## Answering questions

- We can call it an intermediate-parti that executes or does a certain function for us
- Node web framework
- Opinionated frameworks are those with opinions about the "right way" to handle any particular task, on the other hand
  Unopinionated frameworks, by contrast, have far fewer restrictions on the best way to glue components together to achieve a goal, or even what components should be used
- A module is a JavaScript library/file that you can import into other code using Node's require() function. Express itself is a module, as are the middleware and database libraries that we use in our Express applications

---

- Version 9.6.4
- npm install jshint

- The importance of testing anything is to make sure that it will perform the task is required from it and ensuring the work given will be accomplished
- 1- many teams report significant reductions in defect rates, at the cost of a moderate increase in initial development effort
  2- the same teams tend to report that these overheads are more than offset by a reduction in effort in projects’ final phases
  3- although empirical research has so far failed to confirm this, veteran practitioners report that TDD leads to improved design qualities in the code, and more generally a higher degree of “internal” or technical quality, for instance improving the metrics of cohesion and coupling
- two individual pitfalls:
  1- forgetting to run tests frequently
  2- writing too many tests at once
  two team pitfalls:
  1- partial adoption – only a few developers on the team use TDD
  2- poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time

---

- It helps us to stay up to date with all the operation and updates to our code in the development phase
- Continuos Delivery let us make sure that the build is always in a deployable state on the other hand, Continuous Deployment lets Every chnage that passes through automation tests is deployed to production
- For sure github fits into this process becuase it allow the team that is working on the project to stay up to date with all the changes that is happening on the same repository

- Knowing more and more about express features and middlewares
